"""Heaven
I am trying to build a module for specific field of data science.
At the same time learn to manage a public project.

It just started, and I will put anything I like in here, which doesn't 
have to be related with data science, just to enhance my workflow.

If everything goes well, I will make it more specific and usefull in 
the next version.I am new to this whole thing and I look forward some 
usefull advices.

If anyone is interested to this, please let me know:
